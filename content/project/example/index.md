title: "Do Opaque Firms Amplify Propagation of Supply Chain Shocks? Evidence on Real Effects of Inter-firm Information Frictions"
summary: (with *Jessica Kim-Gina*) </br>  <DIV align="justify"> This paper examines the network effects of a firm’s information opacity during supply chain disruptions. We conjecture that inter-firm information frictions are especially costly to firms when their suppliers are hit by unexpected business disruptions because such information can help the undisrupted firms navigate adverse situations. Suppliers’ information environments, in turn, can influence how much the negative shocks spill over to their trading partners. Using natural disasters as firm-specific idiosyncratic shocks on suppliers, we find that customers increasingly search their suppliers’ SEC filings when the shocks hit the suppliers. More importantly, customer firms suffer more when disrupted suppliers have opaque information environments. Moreover, these effects spill over further to other supply chain participants that are not directly linked to disrupted suppliers. These results are consistent with the disrupted firm’s information opacity causing its trade partners to inefficiently re-optimize operations with incomplete information, resulting in more significant economic losses. Overall, our paper highlights the amplification effects of the firm’s information environment and its potential implications on economy-wide shock propagation. </DIV>
