title: "Organization Capital and Information Asymmetry"
summary: (with *Henry Friedman* and *Jessica Kim-Gina*) </br>  <DIV align="justify"> This paper investigates whether organization capital is associated with information asymmetry between corporate insiders and outsiders. Consistent with organization capital creating information asymmetry, we find that it is positively associated with insider trading profits. Organization capital is also associated with lower voluntary disclosure and financial statement readability, implying that organization capital creates information asymmetry that is net beneficial to corporate the insiders. To better understand the potential sources of information asymmetry, we provide evidence on the compositions of organization capital by examining how they map into specific types of intangible assets recognized in mergers and acquisitions. We find that target firmsâ€™ organization capital is significantly associated with marketing-based intangibles and goodwill, consistent with organization capital capturing both risky brand investments and alienable human capital. </DIV>
