title: "Organization Capital, Brand Capital, and Information Asymmetry"
summary: (with *Henry Friedman* and *Jessica Kim-Gina*) </br>  <DIV align="justify"> We develop a refined proxy for Organizational Capital (OC*) by separating Brand Capital (BC) from the commonly used SG&A-based measure of OC. We show that OC* and BC represent distinct constructs, with OC* reflecting firm-specific internal capabilities embedded in corporate systems and BC capturing external-facing brand and customer relationships. Validating our measures, we document that OC* is positively associated with goodwill in M&A transactions, while BC correlates with identifiable customer-related intangibles. Furthermore, OC* aligns with management system quality in ESG scores, whereas BC relates to consumer-related ESG metrics, reinforcing their conceptual distinction. Finally, we examine the relationship between these constructs and information asymmetry. We find that OC* is positively associated with insider trading profits and informed trading, while BC shows no such association, suggesting that different types of intangible assets contribute to information asymmetry to varying degrees. Overall, our study offers straightforward measures of intangibles using widely available data and highlights the importance of distinguishing between different components of intangibles in empirical analyses.
