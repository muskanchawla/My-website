summary: >
  Knowledge-intensive firms rely on employees to generate innovations that drive firm performance, and satisfied employees tend to be more productive. 
  So, we would expect a positive association between firmsâ€™ knowledge intensity and employee satisfaction. 
  However, we find empirically that knowledge intensity is negatively associated with employee satisfaction. 
  This negative association could be beneficial to firms if innovative individuals are inherently less satisfied or if low-satisfaction environments facilitate innovation, but our analyses support neither explanation. 
  Instead, we find that employee satisfaction is positively associated with future innovation. 
  Additional evidence suggests that employee dissatisfaction at knowledge-intensive firms is driven by dissatisfaction with company culture and leadership, particularly among employees who are older, longer-tenured, and who work closer to corporate headquarters. 
  To the extent that employee satisfaction can improve firm outcomes, such as by lowering turnover, our evidence suggests gains from managerial and corporate culture improvements at knowledge-intensive firms.
