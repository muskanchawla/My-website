summary: >
  This paper examines how the expiration of a firm’s intellectual property protection influences its voluntary disclosure strategy.
  We focus on patent expirations in the pharmaceutical industry—a predictable yet adverse event that imposes significant revenue risk.
  Using detailed data on drug-level patent expirations and firm-level disclosures, we find that firms reduce the issuance of quantitative guidance in the quarters surrounding patent expiration.
  While quantitative guidance falls, firms simultaneously increase qualitative disclosures during earnings calls, especially discussions around innovation pipelines and expiration-related challenges.
  We further document that firms engaging in “evergreening” strategies—efforts to extend exclusivity through secondary patents—are less likely to discuss expirations directly, suggesting a substitution between real strategic actions and disclosure.
  Overall, this study highlights how managers strategically adapt disclosure practices to navigate market-anticipated adverse events.
