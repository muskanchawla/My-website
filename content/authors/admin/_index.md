<DIV align="justify"> Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in Accounting and Information Systems at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. My research explores how corporate disclosures shape firm innovation and influence supply chains. I am also interested in the measurement of intangibles and the pharmaceutical space. </DIV>
</br>
<DIV align="justify"> I completed my Ph.D. in Accounting from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Anderson School of Management. I earned my Master's degree in Finance (with Distinction) from the London School of Economics (LSE) and my Bachelor's degree in Commerce (with Honors) from the Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) in India. Before joining UCLA, I worked at CAFRAL, the Reserve Bank of India. </DIV>
