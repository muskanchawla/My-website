<DIV align="justify"> Hello! I am a rising fifth-year Accounting Ph.D. Candidate at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. I am primarily interested in understanding how corporate disclosures impact innovation and influence supply chains. I am also interested in the intangibles and M&A space. I am on the 2023-24 academic job market and expect to graduate in June 2024. 

I earned my Masters degree in Finance (with Distinction) from the London School of Economics in 2017 and my Bachelors degree in Commerce (with Honors) from the Shri Ram College of Commerce in India in 2014. Prior to joining UCLA, I worked as a full-time research assistant at the Reserve Bank of India from 2017 to 2019.
