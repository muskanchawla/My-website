title: "End of Firms’ Intellectual Property (IP) Protection and Voluntary Disclosures"
summary: "This paper examines how the expiration of a firm’s intellectual property protection in-
fluences its voluntary disclosure strategy. We focus on patent expirations in the phar-
maceutical industry, a predictable yet adverse event that imposes significant revenue
risk. Using detailed data on drug-level patent expirations and firm-level disclosures,
we find that firms reduce the issuance of quantitative guidance in the quarters sur-
rounding patent expiration. While quantitative guidance falls, firms simultaneously
increase qualitative disclosures during earnings calls, especially discussions around in-
novation pipelines and expiration-related challenges. We further document that firms
engaging in “evergreening” strategies - efforts to extend exclusivity through secondary
patents—are less likely to discuss expirations directly, suggesting a substitution be-
tween real strategic actions and disclosure. Overall, this study highlights how managers
strategically adapt disclosure practices to navigate market-anticipated adverse events."
